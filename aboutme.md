Hello there. My name is Arindam Kumar and my broad field of interest is artificial intelligence with particular interests in reinforcement learning and computer vision.

I am an undergraduate pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIT(ISM) Dhanbad.

I have been inspired by world's greatest philanthropists Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos. I believe in constant, continuous and creative learning. I enjoy reading books on happiness and investments. I am a storyteller who loves traveling, and loves people and their experiences.

Knowledge of Data Analytics along with a pinch of User Experience make me stand out of crowd. I love data crunching and solving data-driven business problems which carved a path to accomplish industry-recognized certifications, projects and moreover assisted me in acquiring a blend of skill-set - python Programming, Machine Learning, Descriptive Statistics, Inferential Statistics and Data Visualization.

Worked on a plethora of Datasets, projects and also solved a couple of problems using Logistic Regression, Kernel SVM, Random Forests, XGBoost and Neural Network algorithms. Well-equipped with mathematical concepts of Regression and Classification. Fond of gradient boosting - XGBoost, used to upscale the algorithmic model.

I am thriving hard to get closer to perfection everyday by putting in labor to study concepts and apply them in my projects. Clarity of thought process and articulation is one of the major strengths which most of the time acts as edge over others. With real hunger to expand my knowledge base, I look forward for greater opportunities and challenges to sharpen my analytical skill
